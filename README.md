# lant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Segmentation
This project detects and segments plant leaf diseases using image processing and deep learning. OpenCV segments healthy and diseased areas, while a MobileNetV2 model classifies the leaves. It calculates disease severity and extracts leaf shape features to aid early diagnosis and precision agriculture.
